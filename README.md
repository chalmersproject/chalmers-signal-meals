# Chalmers Signal v1
The Chalmers is an internet connected switch that reports whether a homeless shelter is serving food, whether it has bed space, and whether it has space at all. The intention of the device is to radically improve the quality of data the [chalmersbot](https://chalmersbot.app) has to work with, and to improve the quality and speed of shelter referrals.
